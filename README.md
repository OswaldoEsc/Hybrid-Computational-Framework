# Modelling-interdependencies-in-an-electric-motor-manufacturing-process-using-DES Repository

Welcome to the Electric Motor Manufacturing Fault Detection Repository! This project aims to minimize wasted time and costs associated with detecting faults in the manufacturing of electric motors by modeling process interdependencies and identifying faults early in the process.

## Overview
Manufacturing electric motors is a complex process involving deformable materials like copper wire. Detecting faults at the end-of-line tests can result in wasted time and costs due to rework or scrappage. This project proposes a computational framework to model process interdependencies in a complex electric motor manufacturing process involving copper wire as a deformable material.

A Discrete Event Simulation (DES) model was developed to capture process interdependencies and their influence on the generation of faults in a linear coil winding process. The model simulates the behavior of the copper wire in every turn during the coil-winding process and captures electrical and geometrical faults in the wound coil as soon as they appear. The accuracy and reliability of the model were validated with a series of experiments conducted using a lab-based linear coil-winding machine setup and expert feedback from the electrical machine manufacturing industry.

## Repository Contents
This repository contains the following resources:

Data: The raw data, processed data, and experimental results used for the development and validation of the DES model.
Charts: Visualizations showcasing the relationship between input parameters and the occurrence of faults, as well as hotspot regions in the final wound coil.
Documentation: Detailed documentation explaining the methodology, implementation, and usage of the computational framework and DES model.

## Future Work
Potential future work includes integrating the model with live shop floor data to project the state of the coil and determine if or where defects are likely to occur. This real-time fault detection could significantly improve manufacturing efficiency and reduce waste in the electric motor industry.

We encourage contributions and feedback from researchers and industry professionals. Feel free to explore the resources provided in this repository and reach out with any questions, suggestions, or improvements.
